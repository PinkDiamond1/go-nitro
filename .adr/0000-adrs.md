# 0000 - Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

- **We will record decisions about architecture and other important decisions next to the sourcecode in this repository.** This provides a reference for developers in the future who question why the code is as it is. It should reduce the chance of oscillating between multiple solutions to the same problem, or recommitting the same mistakes we have made in the past.
- **There shall be a single hidden folder `.adr` at the top level of the repository**. This aids discoverability, allows each ADR to "attach" to multiple files and folders.
- **Meta-(ADRs) are encouraged.** A meta-ADR records a decision about the ADR process itself -- such as a decision about the format, length or style of ADRs. This ADR is a meta ADR.
